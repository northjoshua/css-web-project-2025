        <h2>Blog</h2>
        <p>This blog documents my journey through the web design and development process. It's both a personal record of
            my growth and a space to reflect on the decisions behind my design choices. Here, I share insights,
            challenges, and the reasoning that shapes each step of building this site.</p>

            <h3>06-21-2025</h3>
            <p>Today marks the official start of my CSS learning journey. With the HTML course now complete, I'm eager
                to build on that foundation and explore how CSS can bring structure to life with style and creativity.
                While today’s objective might seem simple—building the HTML framework that my CSS will enhance—it’s a
                critical step. A well-structured HTML base sets the stage for flexible and impactful design. By laying
                down clean, semantic markup now, I’ll give myself more opportunities to experiment with layout,
                typography, and visual styling as I dive deeper into CSS. I'm excited to see just how far I can push my
                designs as I continue to grow my skills.</p>
