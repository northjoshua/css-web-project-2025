        <h2>Blog</h2>
        <p>This blog documents my journey through the web design and development process. It's both a personal record of
            my growth and a space to reflect on the decisions behind my design choices. Here, I share insights,
            challenges, and the reasoning that shapes each step of building this site.</p>

            <p>Today marks the beginning of my CSS journey. After finishing the HTML course, I am excited to take what I
                learned and see the incredible transformations that CSS is capable of. Today's goal is simple, but still
                very important: Build the HTML framework that my CSS will be applied to. The focus here is the CSS, but
                by having a solid framework I'll increase the number of design opportunities available to me.</p>
